# Exercise 1: Sum Unary

Now it is your turn to write code!

In this exercise, your goal is to implement a Sum RPC Unary API in a CalculatorService:

The function takes a Request message that has two integers, and returns a Response that represents the sum of them.
Remember to first implement the service definition in a .proto file, alongside the RPC messages
Implement the Server code first
Test the server code by implementing the Client
Example:

The client will send two numbers (3 and 10) and the server will respond with (13)

Good luck!
